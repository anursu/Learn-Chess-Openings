# Learn Chess Openings

This is a very simple program that aims to help the user learn different chess openings. This project has been exclusively build on python, using pygame. So be sure to have
pygame installed, if you planning on trying this out. Once you run this program you will be greated with a menu, where you are greeted with 4 different options: "Test Your Knowledge",
"Learn Openings", "Settings", "Credits." The first two options, are the main part of this project. You can select one of them using the arrow keys and the enter key. If you have selected
the "Learn Openings" you will see a new window pop up which will display a randomly selected openings (out of 2014 possible openings), by clicking the right and left keys you can move 
either foward or backwards; once you come to the end of that opening, by clicking the right button once more a new oppening should start. Press escape key, if you would like to exit to 
main menu. Select the "Test Your Knowledge" option and you will be taken to the a new chess board, where you will have to set up a board according to the given opening, if you set up 
the board successfully it will tell yo so, and if not it will let you try again.
